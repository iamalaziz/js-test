# The differences between the variables var, let & const?

To figure out the differences between the these variables, let me go through what are they, their usage rules and features.

> Extra Info: ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) added let and const variable declarations to store values.

- Assigning a value
- Re-initialization
- Reassigning/Updating
- Scope
- Hoisting

### Assigning a value

Apart from common way to assign a value to a variable, we can assign a value after initialization. While this applies for _var_ and _let_, it doesn't apply for _const_.

_var & let_

```
var name;
name = "Velldoris"; //correct
let isOpen;
isOpen = true;  //correct
```

_But, for const_

```
const id;
id = 2323; //incorrect
```

_Instead, we use common way_

```
const id = 2323;
```

### Re-initialization

Only var can be redeclared, let & const variables must be declared only once with a specific variable name.

```
var status = 'success';
var status = 'fail';        //correct
```

```
let status = 'success';
let status = 'fail';        //incorrect

const status = 'success';
const status = 'fail';        //incorrect
```

### Reassining/Updating

While the values of the variables declared with _var_ & _let_ can be updated, values with _const_ declaration cannot be updated.

```
const currNumber = 3;
currNumber = 4; // incorrect
```

### Hoisting

Hoisting is when variable declarations are moved to the beginning of the code while interpreting. This applies for only _var_, not for _let_ & _const_.

```
x = 5;
var x;
console.log(x) // 5
```

```
x = 5;
let x;
console.log(x) // error!
```

### Scope

_var_ is function scoped, but _let_ & _const_ are block scoped. That means _var_ can be accessed throughtout the function, _let_ & _const_ can be accessed within the block.
